# Project for THz Beam Characterization

## Started February 1, 2018

The goal of this project is to determine the beam profile of our Terahertz 
system. There are THz Data scans covering the head of a metal pin. Each scan
covers the (x, y) plane and different height values. 

Scans exist cover a $\pm$ 3mm region around the head of the pin in the (x, y) 
plane. 

There are scans at the following z heights
* +2.5 mm
* +2.0 mm
* +1.5 mm
* +1.0 mm
* +0.5 mm
* 0 mm (focus)
* -0.5 mm
* -1.0 mm
* -1.5 mm
* -2.0 mm
* -2.5 mm
